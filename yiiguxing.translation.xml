The coroutine will be cancelled and re-launched when LaunchedEffect is recomposed with a different key1. The coroutine will be cancelled when the LaunchedEffect leaves the composition. This function should not be used to (re-)launch ongoing tasks in response to callback events by way of storing callback data in MutableState passed to key1. Instead, see rememberCoroutineScope to obtain a CoroutineScope that may be used to launch ongoing jobs scoped to the composition in response to event callbacks." />

      <item value="Transforms elements emitted by the original flow by applying transform, that returns another flow, and then merging and flattening these flows. This operator calls transform sequentially and then merges the resulting flows with a concurrency limit on the number of concurrently collected flows. It is a shortcut for map(transform).flattenMerge(concurrency). See flattenMerge for details. Note that even though this operator looks very familiar, we discourage its usage in a regular application-specific flows. Most likely, suspending operation in map operator will be sufficient and linear transformations are much easier to reason about. Operator fusion Applications of flowOn, buffer, and produceIn after this operator are fused with its concurrent merging so that only one properly configured channel is used for execution of merging logic." />
